Course Syllabus: http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/cxmath10073.htm

## Overview

This repository contains coursework and projects completed during the "Linear Programming, Modelling and Solution" course (MATH10073) at the University of Edinburgh. The course focused on developing skills in mathematical modeling, linear programming (LP), and the application of the simplex algorithm, all implemented using the Xpress mathematical programming system and Mosel language.

## Course Description

The course offered an in-depth exploration of linear programming, a key technique in optimal decision-making and operational research. Key areas covered include:

- **Linear Programming (LP) Fundamentals**: Understanding decision variables, objective functions, constraints, and the feasible region. Exploration of the duality theory, sensitivity analysis, and the concept of fair prices.
- **Mathematical Modelling with Xpress**: Introduction to the Xpress mathematical programming system and the Mosel modeling language to define LP problems, solve them, and analyze results. Emphasis on using these tools for real-world case studies.
- **Simplex Algorithm**: Study of the simplex algorithm, including geometric and algebraic concepts, proof of termination for non-degenerate LPs, and implementation via the revised simplex method.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, I developed the following skills:

1. **LP Modelling and Analysis**: Ability to model, solve, and analyze linear programming problems using Xpress and the Mosel language.
2. **Programming and Software Utilization**: Enhanced programming skills with a focus on mathematical modeling and optimization using Xpress.
3. **Theoretical Understanding**: Deep understanding of the mathematical theory behind LP and the simplex algorithm.
4. **Communication Skills**: Experience in presenting case studies and technical results both orally and in written form.
