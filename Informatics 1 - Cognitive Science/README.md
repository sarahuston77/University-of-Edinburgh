# Informatics 1 - Cognitive Science (INFR08020) - University of Edinburgh

Welcome to the repository for my coursework and projects from the "Informatics 1 - Cognitive Science" course at the University of Edinburgh. This course provides an introduction to the field of cognitive science with a focus on computational models of cognition.

## Course Overview

The "Informatics 1 - Cognitive Science" course (INFR08020) explores various aspects of human cognition, including language, vision, memory, reasoning, and behavior. The course adopts a computational approach to analyze these cognitive functions and involves practical lab sessions where students implement simple cognitive models.

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Language**
   - Cognitive instinct vs. cognitive technology
   - Linguistic representations: productivity and reuse
   - Connectionist and Bayesian models of language
   - Language acquisition, speech segmentation, and word learning
   - Categorization and models of word meaning

2. **Reasoning and Generalization**
   - Inductive reasoning and fallacies
   - Models of abstraction and generalization
   - Theory formation and the origins of knowledge

3. **Fundamentals of Cognitive Neuroscience**
   - Basic brain anatomy and function
   - Experimental techniques to record brain activity
   - Simple models of neurons

4. **Vision**
   - Anatomy of vision and neural correlates of visual perception
   - Comparison of biological and artificial visual systems

5. **Memory and Attention**
   - Types of memory and memory impairments
   - Computational models of memory

6. **Actions and Behavior**
   - Reinforcement learning and decision-making processes

## Projects

### 1. Cognitive Model of Language Processing

- **Description:** Developed a Python-based cognitive model simulating aspects of language processing, including speech segmentation and word learning. The project involved implementing connectionist models to understand how language is processed in the brain.
- **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, SciPy
- **Skills:** Cognitive modeling, computational linguistics, Python programming

### 2. Vision System Simulation

- **Description:** Created a simulation of a vision system comparing biological visual processing with artificial models. The project explored neural correlates of visual perception and implemented basic algorithms for visual data processing.
- **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV
- **Skills:** Computer vision, neuroscience, Python programming

### 3. Memory and Learning Models

- **Description:** Implemented computational models of memory and learning, focusing on reinforcement learning. The project examined different memory types and explored algorithms that mimic learning processes in the brain.
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow
- **Skills:** Machine learning, cognitive science, Python programming
