    "So far, we have seen object types consisting of essentially a single item of data. It is useful to have data types that can represent more than a single value -- for instance, in mathematics, we might want to represent a matrix or a vector. Python offers a number of different built-in object types to do this, called **containers** -- because they can contain other objects with different types. This week, we introduce **lists** as our first type of container.\n",

This week, we also introduce our first control flow tools: **loops** and **functions**.\n",
